# 🎨 Exchange Bridge – IDUX Coursework Design Portfolio

This repository contains the design portfolio submitted as part of **Coursework 1** for the **CO7223: Interaction Design and User Experience (ID&UX)** module at the University of Leicester.

The aim was to design a prototype system that **enhances User Interaction and Experience (UX)** using interaction design principles and user-centered thinking.

---

## 📱 System Overview

**Exchange Bridge** is a community skill and service exchange platform. It enables users to:
- Share services or skills (e.g. English tutoring, cooking lessons)
- Earn/spend **EBCoins**, a virtual currency
- Participate in collaborative projects
- Engage in exchanges without needing immediate reciprocity

Designed for inclusivity, accessibility, and long-term engagement, the app offers basic and advanced features tailored to diverse user needs.

## 🧍 Personas & Scenarios

Two personas and a scenario were developed based on real-world motivations and accessibility needs:

- 👨‍🍳 **Gabriel Bernard** – A single father and chef from France, seeking English lessons and childcare support.
- 👩‍🏫 **Kamala Kumar** – A retired English professor with mobility challenges, passionate about mentoring.

🔁 **Scenario:** Gabriel finds Kamala via the platform for tutoring. In return, he helps Kamala with snow clearing. They both later attend a community event, reflecting the app’s collaborative values.

## 🖼️ Prototype Screens

The medium-fidelity prototype consists of **10+ screens** designed using **Figma**, with a focus on both basic and advanced features:

- Login and Registration (multi-language, accessible layout)
- Home with onboarding and category selection
- Search results and tutor profile
- Request session, upcoming events, and messaging
- Post availability and EBCoin transaction management
- Notifications with geo-fencing and smart recommendations
- Settings and personalization

📄 Full design walkthrough and rationale is provided in `Design Portfolio.pdf`.

## 🧠 Design Rationale

Design decisions were guided by key ID/UX literature:

- Nielsen’s Usability Heuristics
- Don Norman’s Principles of Design
- Laws of UX and Preece, Rogers & Sharp’s interaction design framework
- Gamification and social capital theories (Hamari & Koivisto, Putnam)

All prototype elements emphasize clarity, control, motivation, and inclusive access.
